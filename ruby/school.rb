# Domain Model for a School

# Write a model that stores students along with the grade that they are in.

# ```ruby
# school = School.new("Bayside High School")
# ```

# If no students have been added, the roster should be empty:

# ```ruby
# school.roster
# # => {}
# ```

# When you add a student, they get added to the correct grade.

# ```ruby
# school.add_student("Zach Morris", 9)
# school.roster
# # => {9 => ["Zach Morris"]}
# ```

# You can, of course, add several students to the same grade, and students to different grades.

# ```ruby
# school.add_student("AC Slater", 9)
# school.add_student("Kelly Kapowski", 10)
# school.add_student("Screech", 11)
# school.roster
# # => {9 => ["Zach Morris", "AC Slater"], 10 => ["Kelly Kapowski"], 11 => ["Screech"]}
# ```

# Also, you can ask for all the students in a single grade:

# ```ruby
# school.grade(9)
# # => ["Zach Morris", "AC Slater"]
# ```

# Lastly, you should be able to get a sorted list of all the students. Grades are sorted in descending order numerically, and the students within them are sorted in ascending order alphabetically.

# ```ruby
# school.sort
# # => {9 => ["AC Slater", "Zach Morris"], 10 => ["Kelly Kapowski"], 11 => ["Screech"]}
# ```
# Here's a test suite to help you validate.

# *Install the fis-test gem*
